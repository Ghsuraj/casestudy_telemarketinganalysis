# Bank Telemarketing Campaign Analysis

This project analyzes data from a Portuguese bank’s telemarketing campaigns to evaluate campaign performance and identify factors influencing client subscription to term deposits.

## Data

- Target variable: y (Client subscribed? yes/no)

## Tools and Libraries
- Python 3.11
- Pandas for data cleaning and manipulation
- NumPy for numerical operations
- Matplotlib and Seaborn for static data visualization
- Plotly for interactive data visualization
- SciPy for statistical analysis
- Jupyter Notebook for analysis and reporting

## Workflow
1. Data cleaning and preprocessing (handling types, encoding, and missing values)
2. Feature engineering (contact history, balance bins, etc.)
3. Descriptive statistics and exploratory data analysis (EDA)
4. Visualization of key insights using Seaborn and Plotly
5. Interpretation of trends and campaign performance metrics

## Output
The project provides:
- Visual analysis of campaign results
- Key performance indicators and trends
- Actionable insights to improve telemarketing efficiency

All findings are documented in the accompanying report and presentation.
